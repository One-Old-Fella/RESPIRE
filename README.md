RESPIRE: System Regulation

A high-performance autonomic nervous system regulation tool.

RESPIRE is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help users modulate their physiological state through controlled breathing techniques. Unlike standard meditation apps, RESPIRE treats breath as a mechanism for system control—using precise timing, visual bio-feedback, and psychoacoustic audio to trigger specific biological responses (Up-regulation vs. Down-regulation).

⚡ Core Features

6 Distinct Modes:

Optimal: Resonance frequency (5.5s) for HRV synchronization.

Balance: Box breathing for focus and stress regulation.

Warming: Forceful nasal bellows for metabolic heat.

Cooling: Evaporative cooling for temperature reduction.

Relief: Physiological sigh for acute stress reset.

Energy: Circular breathing for high alertness.

Elemental Visuals: Procedural animations (Campfire, Lotus, Snowflake) that match the goal of the technique.

Psychoacoustic Audio: Dynamic sound engine with low-pass filtering and sub-bass reinforcement.

PWA Architecture: Installable directly to mobile devices; works 100% offline.

Privacy First: No tracking, no cloud storage. All settings are stored locally on the device.
