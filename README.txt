RESPIRE: System Regulation
A high-performance autonomic nervous system regulation tool.
RESPIRE is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help users modulate their physiological state through controlled breathing techniques. Unlike standard meditation apps, RESPIRE treats breath as a mechanism for system control—using precise timing, visual bio-feedback, and psychoacoustic audio to trigger specific biological responses (Up-regulation vs. Down-regulation).
⚡ Core Features
* 6 Distinct Modes:
   * Optimal: Resonance frequency (5.5s) for HRV synchronization.
   * Balance: Box breathing for focus and stress regulation.
   * Warming: Rapid nasal breathing for metabolic heat.
   * Cooling: Sitali technique for temperature reduction.
   * Relief: Physiological sigh for acute stress reset.
   * Energy: Circular breathing for high alertness.
* Elemental Visuals: Procedural animations (Campfire, Lotus, Snowflake) that match the goal of the technique.
* Psychoacoustic Audio: Dynamic sound engine with low-pass filtering and sub-bass reinforcement.
* PWA Architecture: Installable directly to mobile devices; works 100% offline.
* Privacy First: No tracking, no cloud storage. All settings are stored locally on the device.
